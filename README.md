🛠️ **Project Creation:** 
I have developed this website, utilizing the fetch method to access the mealdb API. This API returns an array of meals by dynamically changing the raw ingredient's name in the API URL. Employing the classical `.then()` method, I handled the API response. (I plan to implement async/await in my next project.) After fetching data from the API, I manipulated the DOM to display different recipes based on user input in the search box.

🔥 **Features:**
1. Search recipes by ingredient
2. Random recipe generator
3. Recommended section featuring Indian meals
4. Fully responsive design
5. Coming soon: Search by country feature
